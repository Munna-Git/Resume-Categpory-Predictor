# Resume Category Predictor & Skill Recommender (NLP-based)

This project is an NLP-powered resume categorization system that classifies resumes into predefined job categories and recommends top relevant skills for that role. Built using Python and machine learning techniques, it serves as a foundational tool for automating candidate evaluation in HR tech and recruitment systems.

**✅ Model Accuracy: 99.48%**
**🎯 Model Type: Logistic Regression with TF-IDF**
**📄 Input Formats Supported: .pdf, .txt, .doc, .docx**

## **Problem Statement**
Recruiters often receive a high volume of resumes, making it time-consuming to categorize candidates and match them with suitable job profiles. This project automates that process by:

- **Predicting the Job Category** of a candidate based on their resume content.

- **Recommending Key Skills** that align with the predicted role.

## **Project Workflow**
1. ### **Data Preprocessing**
- Loaded dataset containing resume text and corresponding job categories.

- Cleaned the text using custom *cleanResume()* function:

- Removed URLs, symbols, hashtags, mentions, and non-ASCII characters.

- Applied whitespace normalization.

2. ### **Label Encoding**
- Encoded job categories into numerical values using *LabelEncoder*.

- Saved the encoder as *label_encoder.pkl* for consistent decoding in the app.

3. ### **Feature Extraction**
- Used *TF-IDF Vectorizer* (with 5000 max features and English stopwords) to convert resume text into numerical format.

4. ### **Model Training**
- Applied **Logistic Regression** (max_iter=1000) for multi-class classification.

- Split dataset using an 80/20 train-test ratio.

5. ### **Evaluation**
- Achieved **99.48%** accuracy on test data.

- Evaluated with *accuracy_score* and *classification_report*.

6. ### **Model Serialization**
- Saved the following for deployment:

- *clf.pkl* -> Trained Logistic Regression model

- *tfidf.pkl* -> TF-IDF vectorizer

- *label_encoder.pkl* -> Label Encoder

## 🌐 **Web Application**
A Streamlit-based web app allows users to paste their resumes. Right now the app.py doesn't support uploading files in different formats.

The app:

- Extracts and cleans text.

- Predicts the resume category.

- Displays top 5 recommended skills for the category using a hardcoded skill mapping dictionary.

### **Skills Mapping**
The *skills_mapping* dictionary maps each predicted category to a curated list of essential industry-relevant skills. These are displayed dynamically based on the model’s prediction.

## Key Features
- Supports multiple resume formats

- Automated category prediction

- Relevant skill recommendations

- Cleaned and normalized NLP pipeline

- Reusable ML artifacts (.pkl files)

## Future Enhancements
🧠 Integrate Named Entity Recognition (NER) for skill extraction from resumes.

📈 Expand dataset for broader job roles and industries.

☁️ Deploy on cloud (e.g., Heroku, AWS, or Streamlit Cloud).

📥 Include a downloadable report summarizing prediction.

📈 Update the app.py file to actually map the suggested skills to the skills in the resume.
